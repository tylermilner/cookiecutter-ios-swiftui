As this is an iOS app, you'll need to have a working development environment for
Apple applications. For this project, you'll need:

- Mac running the latest macOS.
- Latest version of Xcode installed.
- Homebrew with `mint` package installed.
- Ruby with `bundler` gem installed.

_TBD_: Expand on how where to get Xcode, how to install Homebrew and `mint`,
and how to install Ruby (via version manager like `rbenv`) and `bundler`.

### Running the Project

- [ ] TODO: Fill in `git clone` repo URL below.

1. Clone or download this repo - `git clone ...`.
2. Install build dependencies - `bundle install` and `mint bootstrap`.
3. Open `{{ cookiecutter.__project_name_no_spaces }}.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
4. Click "Run" or press `CMD` + `R` shortcut.

### Running Tests

Tests can be run inside of Xcode using the `CMD` + `U` shortcut or run via Fastlane:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane ios test
```

A convenience script is also available:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

### Creating a Build

A build can be creating using Xcode or via Fastlane:

_TBD_: Document the build creation process.
